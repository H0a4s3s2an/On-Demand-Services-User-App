# On Demand Services App

## User App

This was my final year university project that i had done in back 2018. It was consist of 2 native android apps one for users and other for service providers.
Basically the idea was to provide different daily base services to users online on reasonable rates. Online service providers will be shown on map who are online and user can send real time reuest to nearest one.
